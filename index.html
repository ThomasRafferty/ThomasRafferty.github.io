    <h3>Creation Story</h3>
    <p>I use to water my boss's garden at my old job, yet had never done any gardening myself.  Upon moving to Brooklyn I decided once the spring rolled around I would give it a shot.  I have really enjoyed it as a hobby, particularly to take my mind off the tumultuous times we currently reside.  I built the box myself with my brother's power drill and  supplies from home depot.  The joys of eating something I have grown myself have be wonderful.</p>

    <p>I have found this to be a helpful site about how often to water my garden.  It has a fair of adds, and makes you flip through pages (I believe to get more hits) but has some useful content.  Yet, people got to pay their bills.</p>
